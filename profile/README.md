# About-Us
We are a NGO from Tbilisi, Georgia. Our goal is to fill the gap in the knowledge of society left by the lack of data and data communication. We do so by systematically collecting, analysing and visualising data. Topics are around social issues ranging from conflict analysis to the mobility. All the members come from academia which makes our organisation partly a research group. 

We are oriented towards opennes and strive to create open access resources to help those who share the same interests in data visualisation. You can find our online course (in Georgian) in [data analysis and visualisation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfQdgroGNcmyWaTOZNOFaJ5iUNAbH-60m) here, at Ilia State University.  

Here on our GitHub page you'll find our project repositories with source codes and visualisations. Mostly it is only our enthusiasm that fuels our work, so for extra fuel you can donate for as at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zaxis). 

We are open for collaboration and for providing services as well. Reach out directly if you are interested in working with us.
